<p>
Checking in again on some updates after a 14-day streak of practicing the Wim Hof Method.
</p>

<p>
    I haven't noticed any negative effects so far of practicing the Wim Hof Method -- including the breathing method, cold water immersion, and focus / concentration.
</p>

<p>
    I did have some concerns in that after 4-6 rounds of breathing, I would experience a ringing in the ears, which gradually grew louder, as well as tingling in my hands. However, I've since learned that this is a positive affect of oxygen saturation in the blood from the method.

<h3>Some positives:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
    <strong>I'm losing weight</strong>. This is likely a combination of the cold water immersion (which burns fat), and an increased motivation to exercise.
    </li>

    <li>
        I haven't reacted to my wife with anger or frustration during times I normally would.
    </li>

    <li>
        The "blues" that I normally experience (especially during the fall season) aren't happening.
    </li>

    <li>
        Increased desire to pursue my teenage & childhood loves. I bought a guitar and began playing music again (I used to play <strong><em>every day</em></strong>).
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Stay tuned for more...</p>
