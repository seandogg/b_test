## Websites, Web Apps && More
I didn't set out to compose software for a living. I figured I'd work outdoors, tour with a band playing music, or travel the world surfing & snowboarding (all of which I can say I've done). But life has a strange way of unexpectedly happening.

What began as a hobby in school eventually became my full-time trade, and here we are. On the internet. Together.

### The Early Days
It was 2002. I was a student in the journalism department at CSU Long Beach. Luckily the university had the foresight to see the inevitable demise of the printed newspaper. We were encouraged to study `html` and `css` in addition to the regular curricula of `design`, `copy editing`, `writing` and `investigative journalism`. 

Indeed, printed newspaper sales were crashing as our sources of information shifted to the web. Newspapers were struggling to transition into new income streams and hurting. The war was raging with full-force and it was probably the worst time to find a job in the news business.

I was offered a design job at a local newspaper. The offer was for $22,000 USD per year. I declined and decided to drift around.

### The Earlier Days
I always kept up those `html` and `css` chops. For fun really... I'd grown up with computers so I knew my way around. I'd blog, make sites for fun and just mess around. Nothing serious. Yet.
