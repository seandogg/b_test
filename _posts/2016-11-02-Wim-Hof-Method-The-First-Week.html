<p>
    I'm on the fifth day of practicing the Wim Hof Method. To be honest, I have no idea if I'm doing it correct, because I'm still too cheap to shell out the $200 bones for the 10-week class. I'm still using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvkY3RCzBAnHh4AAMVrOQUQ" target="_blank">Verical Addiction's</a> video as my basic guide. And so far, it's working out.

<p>
    <strong>Things I've noticed during my first 5-days of WHM breathing and cold showers:</strong>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        No desire whatsoever to delve into my usual daily vices (beer, weed, caffeine).
    </li>

    <li>
        An increased desire to workout and meditate.
    </li>

    <li>
        Work & family stresses feel much easier to handle.
    </li>

    <li>
        A "toughness" coupled with a relaxed happiness.
    </li>

    <li>
        More conscious of my breath during the waking day
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>What Sucks About Me</h3>

<p>Like all humans, I've got issues. Typically don't share it on the internet, but tbh I've always struggled with depression.</p>

<p>It started as a teenager, but I was lucky to fall into a friendship with Dr. Pierre Grimes, who taught philosophy at Goldenwest College in Huntington Beach, where I grew up. At 18 I was desperate to dive into yoga, taichi and meditation, and Grimes had the experience I needed. I've stayed deep friends with him since then, and have been fortunate to "break-through" many of the false beliefs about myself that carried over from childhood.</p>

<h3>My Son Changed Everything</h3>

<p>
    This year my wife and I had a son. Long story short, my life has changed drastically over the past few months in order to become a responsible father. <strong>Essentially I've submitted to ego-death.</strong> The goals and aspirations (snowboarding, surfing, etc) I once had have basically shifted to raising my son and being a Dad. This doesn't come without a significant kick-back from the old self. It causes some shit states of mind.
</p>

<h3>Frustration and Anger Have Always Been My Problem.</h3>

<p>The roller-coaster that is the first 6-months of a newborn's life will rattle a man's soul. Sleep deprivation, bickering with my wife, stressing about what the baby needs, trying to work full-time... holy shit. Sometimes it seems it's just too fucking much.</p>

<p><strong>I've coped with the stress by smoking weed</strong> (I have a license under CA prop 215 - it's legal for us in California). It's always been my go-to anti-stress, anti-anxiety friend. And I've always preferred it to drinking & booze.
</p>

<p>After breathing with the Wim Hof Method and taking cold showers, I honestly haven't felt the <strong><em>need</em></strong> to smoke. I'm not saying I wouldn't still indulge, I just don't feel that <strong><em>NEED</em></strong>. I assume this may be my endocrine system adjusting to the Wim Hof Method breathing and freezing cold showers, perhaps that practice alone is regulating the stress of daily life which would typically drive me to the ganja.</p>

<h3>My Plan</h3>

<p>I'd like to confirm that the practice I'm doing is actually Wim Hof Method. I'll eventually need to buy the package, but in the meantime, I'm very much enjoying the WHM practice I've setup as my morning routine.</p>

<p>I'll continue to post here as I go. Until then, <strong>Breathe Motherfucker!!</strong></p>
